# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

The Refactoring Participant is a VS Code extension that enhances the coding experience by providing intelligent refactoring suggestions. It exists to:

1. **Improve Code Quality**: Help developers identify and implement refactoring opportunities that might otherwise be missed.
2. **Save Developer Time**: Automate the process of suggesting and implementing code improvements.
3. **Educate Developers**: Provide explanations about why specific refactorings improve code quality, helping developers learn better coding practices.
4. **Integrate with GitHub Copilot**: Leverage AI capabilities to provide context-aware refactoring suggestions.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Code Maintenance Challenges**: Makes it easier to maintain and improve existing codebases by suggesting targeted refactorings.
2. **Knowledge Gaps**: Not all developers are equally familiar with refactoring techniques; this extension helps bridge that gap.
3. **Inconsistent Code Quality**: Helps maintain consistent code quality standards across a project.
4. **Time-Consuming Manual Refactoring**: Reduces the time and effort required to identify and implement refactorings.
5. **Difficulty in Identifying Refactoring Opportunities**: Uses AI to spot potential improvements that might be missed by developers.

## How It Should Work

1. **Selection-Based Refactoring**:
   - Users can select code in their editor and request refactoring suggestions.
   - If no selection is made, a scope picker dialog allows users to select a range for refactoring.

2. **AI-Powered Suggestions**:
   - The extension uses GitHub Copilot's language models to analyze the selected code.
   - It generates intelligent refactoring suggestions based on best practices and code patterns.

3. **Specialized Refactoring Categories**:
   - Performance improvements
   - Code duplication removal
   - Understandability enhancements
   - Idiomatic code patterns
   - Code smell elimination
   - Error handling improvements

4. **Interactive Workflow**:
   - Suggestions appear in the Chat view with options to:
     - Preview changes in a diff editor
     - Apply the suggested refactorings
     - Request alternative suggestions

5. **Chat Commands**:
   - Users can use slash commands in the Chat view to request specific types of refactoring suggestions.

6. **Configuration Options**:
   - Users can configure which language model to use (GPT-4 or GPT-3.5).

The extension is designed to be non-intrusive, providing suggestions only when requested, and giving the developer full control over which refactorings to apply.
